# algoritmia_fundamentals
This repository contains the exercises proposed during the subject "Fundamentos de Algoritmia". 

In these exercises, the objetive is to implement an algorithm that receives the input of the .in file and returns the expected output indicated in the .out file. 

The algorithms must be the most efficient possible in order to pass the DomJudge tests. 

These exercises requiere iterative algorithm, recursive algorithms, Divide-and-conquer algorithms and Backtracking algorithms.
