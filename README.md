# algoritmia_fundamentals
This repository contains the exercises proposed during the subject "Algoritmia Fundamentals". 

In these exercises, the objetive is to implement an algorithm that receives the input of the .in file and returns the expected output indicated in the .out file. The algorithms must be the most efficient possible in order to pass the DomJudge tests. 

Each exercise requires the implementation of one of the following types of algorithms:
- Iterative algorithm
- Recursive algorithm
- Divide-and-conquer algorithm
- Backtracking algorithm
